<h1>My experience during MCO period</h1>
<p>Its about how i facing and fulfill my time during MCO period.Like everybody knows,all country are strugling to fight the dangerous virus which is corona virus or known as Covid-19.So,our government have take fast action to avoid the spreading of this virus by doing Movement Control Order(MCO).MCO is an order from government to stay at home to cut off the spreading of virus.The restriction includes cancellation of all the religious activities and social activities, closure of school, universities and also closure of all government and business excluding essential services. Now we already at third phase of MCO and hopefully the corona virus will immediately disappears and MCO will ended soon. During MCO period which started from 18 March 2020, My family and I are obey to order from government to stay at home except for buy the necesities and grocery things.This period is quite challenging to all people including me.It is because our movement are limited and feel so bored by just staying at home for long time period.
